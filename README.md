# Stack Implementation in C

This repository showcases a versatile stack implementation in C, offering both array and linked list representations. The menu-driven interface allows users to interact with and explore various stack operations.

## Features

- **Array Implementation:** Utilizes a fixed-size array for stack operations.
- **Linked List Implementation:** Dynamically manages nodes in a linked list for stack operations.
- **Menu-Driven Interface:** Intuitive menu system for pushing, popping, and displaying elements.
- **Flexibility:** Demonstrates the flexibility of choosing between array and linked list representations for basic stack operations.

## Code Structure

- **`main.c`:** Entry point for the program, contains the main menu and menu-driven logic.
- **`stack_operations.c`:** Implements stack operations for both array and linked list.
- **`stack_operations.h`:** Header file with function declarations for stack operations.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stack-implementation-c.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
  cd stack-implementation-c

3. Compile and run the program:

  ```bash
  gcc main.c stack_operations.c -o stack_program
./stack_program
